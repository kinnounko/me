    <h2>Geography IA</h2>
    <p>
        We were instructed to conduct multiple surveys about the environmental quality of Paris.
        I built an interactive map for programmatic adding of locations and such that can be found <a href="/notes/2020/geo/map.html">here</a>, as well as one for the locations of the <a href="/notes/2020/geo/tree_map.html">trees</a>, in order to determine the clustered vs regular nature of them.
        I used <a href="https://github.com/kinnounko/notes/blob/main/geography/ia/tree_nn_calculator.py">this</a> Python program I made to calculate the NNI, or nearest neighbor index of the disparity of trees in both locations.
        $$Rn = \frac{\bar D(Obs)}{(0.5) \sqrt{\frac{a}{n}}}$$
