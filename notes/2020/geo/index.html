    <h2>Geography IA</h2>
    <p>
        We were instructed to conduct multiple surveys about the environmental quality of Paris.
        I built an interactive map for programmatic adding of locations and such that can be found <a href="/notes/2020/geo/map.html">here</a>, as well as one for the locations of the <a href="/notes/2020/geo/tree_map.html">trees</a>, in order to determine the clustered vs regular nature of them.
